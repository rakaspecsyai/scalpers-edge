# Scalper's Edge: Crypto Scalping Signal Dashboard

A futuristic, React-based dashboard prototype designed to identify potential crypto scalping signals. This tool fetches market data from the AsterDEX API and applies common technical indicators to generate simple trading signals.

This project was built as a high-fidelity prototype to explore strategy visualization and front-end data handling with Next.js.

## 🚀 Features

"Real-Time-ish" Data: Automatically fetches 1-day market data (1-minute granularity) from the AsterDEX API every 1 minute.

Selectable Strategies: Analyze markets using:

- RSI (Relative Strength Index)

- Stochastic Oscillator

- A combination of both RSI + Stochastic

Clear Signals: Provides immediate "LONG", "SHORT", or "NEUTRAL" signal cards based on the selected strategy's parameters.

Data Visualization: Clean price and indicator charts powered by Recharts to visualize market movements and indicator values.

Mocked Performance: A simulated "Backtest Performance" panel (displaying Win Rate, P/L, etc.) to visualize what a strategy's historical performance could look like.

Futuristic UI: A responsive, dark-mode dashboard built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, using lucide-react for icons.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- ### Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router)

- ### Language: JavaScript (React)

- ### Styling: Tailwind CSS

- ### Data Visualization: Recharts

- ### Icons: Lucide React

- ### Data Source: AsterDEX API

## 💻 Getting Started (Running Locally)

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

**Node.js (v18.0 or later recommended) installed on your system.**

## Installation & Setup

Create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest scalpers-edge
```

When prompted, select the following options:

```bash
Would you like to use TypeScript? No`

Would you like to use ESLint? Yes

Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? Yes

Would you like to use 'src/' directory? No

Would you like to use App Router? Yes
```

Navigate into your new project:

```bash
cd scalpers-edge
```

Install necessary libraries:

```bash
npm install recharts lucide-react
```

Add the Code:

Completely replace the contents of `app/page.jsx` with the code for this project.

Leave `app/globals.css` as-is. The default file generated by `create-next-app` will work fine. Our dashboard's styles will override the defaults.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the dashboard live.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

Mocked Backtesting: The "Backtest Performance" panel is 100% simulated with random data on each run. It does not reflect the true historical performance of the strategies shown.

Data Specialization: This market data uses ASTERDEX api. The klines data may vary againts others CEX/DEX. This is purely open source, you can edit the market data you want.

No Financial Advice: The signals generated should not be considered financial advice. Nothing is certain.
