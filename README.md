Scalper's Edge: Crypto Scalping Signal Dashboard

A futuristic, React-based dashboard prototype designed to identify potential crypto scalping signals. This tool fetches market data from the CoinGecko API and applies common technical indicators to generate simple trading signals.

This project was built as a high-fidelity prototype to explore strategy visualization and front-end data handling with Next.js.

üöÄ Features

"Real-Time-ish" Data: Automatically fetches 1-day market data (1-minute granularity) from the CoinGecko API every 3 minutes.

Selectable Strategies: Analyze markets using:

RSI (Relative Strength Index)

Stochastic Oscillator

A combination of both RSI + Stochastic

Clear Signals: Provides immediate "LONG", "SHORT", or "NEUTRAL" signal cards based on the selected strategy's parameters.

Data Visualization: Clean price and indicator charts powered by Recharts to visualize market movements and indicator values.

Mocked Performance: A simulated "Backtest Performance" panel (displaying Win Rate, P/L, etc.) to visualize what a strategy's historical performance could look like.

Futuristic UI: A responsive, dark-mode dashboard built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, using lucide-react for icons.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router)

Language: JavaScript (React)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Data Visualization: Recharts

Icons: Lucide React

Data Source: CoinGecko Public API

üíª Getting Started (Running Locally)

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

Prerequisites:

Node.js (v18.0 or later recommended) installed on your system.

Installation & Setup:

Create a new Next.js project:

npx create-next-app@latest scalpers-edge


When prompted, select the following options:

Would you like to use TypeScript? No

Would you like to use ESLint? Yes

Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? Yes

Would you like to use 'src/' directory? No

Would you like to use App Router? Yes

Navigate into your new project:

cd scalpers-edge


Install necessary libraries:

npm install recharts lucide-react


Add the Code:

Completely replace the contents of app/page.jsx with the code for this project.

Leave app/globals.css as-is. The default file generated by create-next-app will work fine. Our dashboard's styles will override the defaults.

Run the development server:

npm run dev


Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the dashboard live.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

This is a prototype for educational and demonstration purposes only. It is NOT intended for live trading.

Data Limitations: The CoinGecko API provides 1-minute granularity data, which is used here to simulate a 5m timeframe. Furthermore, the API only provides a single price point, not true OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data. This limits the accuracy of indicators like the Stochastic Oscillator.

Mocked Backtesting: The "Backtest Performance" panel is 100% simulated with random data on each run. It does not reflect the true historical performance of the strategies shown.

No Financial Advice: The signals generated are illustrative and should not be considered financial advice.
